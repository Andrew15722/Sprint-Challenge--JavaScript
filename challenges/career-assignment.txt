- How did your test results compare to your understanding of yourself?

It was pretty accurate I took the test twice but I feel like I am a little of both of the results I got.

- Do you disagree with any aspects of your quiz results?

A few of the extraverted things I disagree with but, mostly I agree with everything.

- How can you use this information (or your own previous understanding of your personality and work ethic) to influence how you work in teams with others?

I can use it to add some positivity to teams I'm in and break the ice with people. Maybe give feed back when I feel its necassary.
